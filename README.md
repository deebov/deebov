### Hey, nice to see you here ðŸ˜‰

I like (coffee) to make products that give users a great UX. I like to use React (Native), TypeScript, Redux and GraphQL as my main tech stack. 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Making the web accessible
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UI/UX
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting/unsual projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with React, TypeScript and JavaScript
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about React, TypeScript and JavaScript
- âš¡ Fun fact: I haven't watched any episode of "Game of Thrones"


P.s. Nowadays I'm not very active in the open-source community because I have a full-time job at the moment.
